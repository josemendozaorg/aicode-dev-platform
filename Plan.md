## Feature Flag Strategy

### Feature Flag Architecture

**Feature Flag Management System**: LaunchDarkly or custom solution with Redis backend
**Flag Types**: Boolean toggles, percentage rollouts, user segment targeting, multivariate testing
**Integration Points**: Application code, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring systems

### Progressive Rollout Strategy

**Rollout Phases**:
1. **Internal Testing** (0-5%): Development team and internal stakeholders
2. **Beta Testing** (5-15%): Selected power users and early adopters
3. **Limited Release** (15-50%): Staged rollout with monitoring
4. **General Availability** (50-100%): Full user base with continued monitoring
5. **Flag Cleanup**: Remove flags after stable deployment

**User Segmentation Strategy**:
- **Internal Users**: Development team, QA, internal stakeholders
- **Beta Users**: Opted-in users willing to test new features
- **Power Users**: High-engagement users with advanced usage patterns
- **General Users**: Standard user base
- **Enterprise Users**: Enterprise customers with specific requirements

### A/B Testing and Feedback Collection

**A/B Testing Framework**:
- Statistical significance calculation with 95% confidence interval
- Minimum sample size validation before conclusion
- Automated winner selection based on predefined success metrics
- Gradual traffic shifting from losing variants

**Success Metrics by Feature Type**:
- **AI Features**: Task completion rate, accuracy, user satisfaction
- **UI Features**: Conversion rate, engagement time, user feedback
- **Performance Features**: Load time, error rate, resource utilization
- **Security Features**: Security incident reduction, compliance metrics

**Feedback Collection Methods**:
- In-app feedback widgets with contextual prompts
- User surveys triggered after feature usage
- Analytics event tracking for behavior analysis
- Support ticket analysis for issue identification

### Risk Management and Rollback

**Automated Kill Switches**:
- Performance degradation thresholds (>10% latency increase)
- Error rate thresholds (>1% increase in errors)
- Security incident triggers (abnormal access patterns)
- User feedback thresholds (satisfaction score <3.5/5)

**Rollback Procedures**:
1. **Immediate Rollback**: <5 minutes for critical issues
2. **Graceful Rollback**: 15-30 minutes for non-critical issues
3. **Partial Rollback**: Target specific user segments or regions
4. **Feature Degradation**: Disable advanced features while maintaining core functionality

**Emergency Procedures**:
```
1. Incident Detection (automated alerts or manual report)
2. Impact Assessment (severity, user impact, business risk)
3. Rollback Decision (kill switch activation or gradual rollback)
4. Communication (internal teams, affected users if necessary)
5. Root Cause Analysis (post-incident review and prevention)
6. Recovery Planning (re-enable with fixes or alternative approach)
```

### Feature Flag Implementation Guide

**Code Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// React component with feature flag
import { useFeatureFlag } from '@/hooks/useFeatureFlag';

function AIAssistant() {
  const isAdvancedAIEnabled = useFeatureFlag('advanced-ai-capabilities');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <BasicAIFeatures />
      {isAdvancedAIEnabled && <AdvancedAIFeatures />}
    </div>
  );
}

// Backend API with feature flag
const { getFeatureFlag } = require('@/services/featureFlags');

app.get('/api/recommendations', async (req, res) => {
  const useMLRecommendations = await getFeatureFlag(
    'ml-recommendations',
    req.user.id
  );
  
  if (useMLRecommendations) {
    return res.json(await getMLRecommendations(req.user));
  } else {
    return res.json(await getBasicRecommendations(req.user));
  }
});
```

**Configuration Management**:
```json
{
  "features": {
    "advanced-ai-capabilities": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rolloutPercentage": 25,
      "userSegments": ["beta-users", "power-users"],
      "killSwitch": {
        "errorRateThreshold": 0.01,
        "performanceThreshold": 1.1
      }
    },
    "new-ui-design": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rolloutPercentage": 10,
      "abTest": {
        "variants": ["control", "variant-a", "variant-b"],
        "trafficSplit": [60, 20, 20],
        "successMetric": "conversion_rate"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment and Deployment Planning

### Environment Strategy

**Environment Hierarchy**:
1. **Development**: Feature development and local testing
2. **Testing**: Automated testing and QA validation  
3. **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
4. **Production**: Live environment serving end users

**Environment Characteristics**:

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Deployment | Monitoring |
|------------|---------|------|------------|------------|
| Development | Feature dev | Synthetic | Manual/Auto | Basic |
| Testing | QA validation | Test fixtures | Automated | Enhanced |
| Staging | Production rehearsal | Production-like | Automated | Full |
| Production | Live service | Production | Blue-green | Comprehensive |

### Infrastructure as Code

**Tool Stack**:
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for cloud resource provisioning
- **Configuration**: Ansible for server configuration management
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management and security

**Repository Structure**:
```

```

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**Pipeline Stages**:

1. **Source Control**: Git-based workflow with branch protection
2. **Build**: Multi-stage Docker builds with layer caching
3. **Test**: Parallel execution of unit, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Security**: SAST, DAST, and dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Package**: Container image building and registry push
6. **Deploy**: Environment-specific deployment with validation
7. **Monitor**: Post-deployment health checks and alerting

**Deployment Strategies**:

**Blue-Green Deployment** (Production):
- Maintains two identical production environments
- Switches traffic instantly between environments
- Enables rapid rollback with zero downtime
- Full validation in blue environment before traffic switch

**Canary Deployment** (Gradual Rollout):
- Deploys to subset of production traffic (5-10%)
- Monitors key metrics for regression detection
- Gradually increases traffic based on success criteria
- Automatic rollback on performance or error thresholds

**Rolling Deployment** (Standard Updates):
- Updates instances gradually with health checks
- Maintains service availability during deployment
- Configurable batch size and update intervals
- Automatic pause on failure detection

### Database Migration and Versioning

**Migration Strategy**:
- **Backward Compatible**: Migrations must not break existing code
- **Rollback Capable**: All migrations include rollback procedures
- **Tested**: Migrations tested in all environments before production
- **Monitored**: Migration execution monitoring with alerting

**Versioning Approach**:
```sql
-- Migration file: 001_create_users_table.up.sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Migration file: 001_create_users_table.down.sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

**Data Migration Tools**:
- **Schema Migrations**: Flyway or Liquibase for version control
- **Data Migrations**: Custom scripts with validation and rollback
- **Migration Testing**: Automated testing against production data copies
- **Zero-Downtime**: Online schema changes with minimal lock time

### Monitoring and Observability

**Monitoring Stack**:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana for time-series data
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **APM**: Application performance monitoring with custom dashboards

**Alert Management**:
```yaml
# Example Prometheus alert rules
groups:
  - name: ai-platform-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          
      - alert: AIAgentFailure
        expr: ai_agent_task_failure_rate > 0.15
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "AI agent failure rate above threshold"
```

**Health Check Framework**:
- **Liveness Probes**: Service availability checks
- **Readiness Probes**: Service ready to handle traffic
- **Dependency Checks**: External service health validation
- **Custom Health Endpoints**: Business-specific health indicators
