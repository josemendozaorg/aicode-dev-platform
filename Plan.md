## Development Principles

### Core Values
1. **Working Software Over Documentation**
   - Focus on functional features first
   - Document what works, not what's planned
   - User feedback drives development priorities

2. **Incremental Development**
   - One feature at a time approach
   - Each version must be fully functional
   - No premature optimization or complex features

3. **Realistic Version Numbers**
   - Version numbers reflect actual capabilities
   - Alpha/beta designations used honestly
   - No marketing-driven version inflation

4. **Evidence-Based Decisions**
   - Manual testing validates all features
   - User feedback drives feature priorities
   - Performance metrics guide optimization

### Quality Standards

#### Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript for type safety
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Proper authentication and authorization

#### Security  
- [ ] JWT tokens with proper expiration
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Security headers (helmet middleware)

#### Testing
- [ ] Manual testing procedures documented
- [ ] All endpoints tested with various scenarios  
- [ ] Error conditions validated
- [ ] Edge cases identified and tested
