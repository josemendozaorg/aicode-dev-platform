## Core Concepts

Before diving in, let's understand the key concepts that power our platform:

### ü§ñ AI Agent Orchestration

Our platform uses multiple AI agents that work together to handle different aspects of development:

- **Project Manager Agent**: Handles planning, task breakdown, and project coordination
- **Developer Agent**: Writes code, implements features, and handles technical tasks
- **Quality Assurance Agent**: Reviews code, runs tests, and ensures quality standards
- **DevOps Agent**: Manages deployments, monitoring, and infrastructure concerns

### üéØ Human-in-the-Loop Decisions

You maintain control over critical decisions:

- **Architecture Choices**: Major design and architecture decisions require your approval
- **Feature Specifications**: AI suggests implementations, you approve the approach
- **Code Review Gates**: Human review points for quality and business logic validation
- **Deployment Decisions**: When and how to deploy changes to production

### üîÑ Agile Workflow Integration

Seamlessly integrate with your existing processes:

- **Sprint Planning**: AI helps estimate and plan sprints based on historical data
- **Backlog Management**: Automatically organize and prioritize work items
- **GitHub Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub Projects and Issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into development progress and blockers

### üì± Cross-Platform Development

Build once, deploy everywhere:

- **Android First**: Optimized for mobile development with Android as the primary target
- **Web Applications**: Responsive web applications using modern frameworks
- **Desktop Applications**: Cross-platform desktop apps with native performance
- **Shared Components**: Reuse code and components across different platforms
