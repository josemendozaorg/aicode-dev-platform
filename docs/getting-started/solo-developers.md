  - Apply your code organization style
```

### Step 3: Build Your First Feature (15 minutes)

Let's create a user authentication system as an example:

#### Feature Request
```
"I need a user authentication system with email/password login, 
registration, password reset, and JWT token management. 
Include proper error handling and security best practices."
```

#### AI-Generated Solution
The platform will generate:

1. **Backend API** (if applicable):
```javascript
// Generated Express.js authentication routes
const express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const User = require('../models/User');

const router = express.Router();

// Register endpoint with comprehensive validation
router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, password, name } = req.body;
    
    // Validation
    if (!email || !password || !name) {
      return res.status(400).json({ 
        error: 'Email, password, and name are required' 
      });
    }
    
    if (password.length < 8) {
      return res.status(400).json({ 
        error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters long' 
      });
    }
    
    // Check if user exists
    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (existingUser) {
      return res.status(400).json({ 
        error: 'User with this email already exists' 
      });
    }
    
    // Hash password
    const saltRounds = 12;
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
    
    // Create user
    const user = new User({
      email,
      password: hashedPassword,
      name
    });
    
    await user.save();
    
    // Generate JWT
    const token = jwt.sign(
      { userId: user._id, email: user.email },
      process.env.JWT_SECRET,
      { expiresIn: '24h' }
    );
    
    res.status(201).json({
      message: 'User created successfully',
      token,
      user: {
        id: user._id,
        email: user.email,
        name: user.name
      }
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

2. **Frontend Components**:
```tsx
// Generated React authentication component
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';

export const LoginForm: React.FC = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const { login } = useAuth();
  
  const validateForm = () => {
    const newErrors: Record<string, string> = {};
    
    if (!email) {
      newErrors.email = 'Email is required';
    } else if (!/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(email)) {
      newErrors.email = 'Email is invalid';
    }
    
    if (!password) {
      newErrors.password = 'Password is required';
    } else if (password.length < 8) {
      newErrors.password = 'Password must be at least 8 characters';
    }
    
    setErrors(newErrors);
    return Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0;
  };
  
  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    if (!validateForm()) return;
    
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      await login(email, password);
      // Redirect handled by useAuth hook
    } catch (error) {
      setErrors({ general: 'Invalid email or password' });
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="login-form">
      <div className="form-group">
        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
        <input
          id="email"
          type="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          className={errors.email ? 'error' : ''}
          disabled={loading}
        />
        {errors.email && <span className="error-message">{errors.email}</span>}
      </div>
      
      <div className="form-group">
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input
          id="password"
          type="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
          className={errors.password ? 'error' : ''}
          disabled={loading}
        />
        {errors.password && <span className="error-message">{errors.password}</span>}
      </div>
      
      {errors.general && <div className="error-message">{errors.general}</div>}
      
      <button type="submit" disabled={loading} className="submit-button">
        {loading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Log In'}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

3. **Comprehensive Tests**:
```typescript
// Generated test suite
describe('Authentication API', () => {
  describe('POST /api/auth/register', () => {
    it('should register a new user with valid data', async () => {
      const userData = {
        email: 'test@example.com',
        password: 'securepassword123',
        name: 'Test User'
      };
      
      const response = await request(app)
        .post('/api/auth/register')
        .send(userData)
        .expect(201);
      
      expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('token');
      expect(response.body.user).toEqual({
        id: expect.any(String),
        email: userData.email,
        name: userData.name
      });
    });
    
    it('should reject registration with weak password', async () => {
      const userData = {
        email: 'test@example.com',
        password: 'weak',
        name: 'Test User'
      };
      
      const response = await request(app)
        .post('/api/auth/register')
        .send(userData)
        .expect(400);
      
      expect(response.body.error).toContain('Password must be at least 8 characters');
    });
    
    // Additional comprehensive test cases...
  });
});
```
